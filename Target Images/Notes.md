#About Target Images

##Design
These designs are not final! The application is not meant to look exaclty like this! It's just a rough idea. Obviously, we should make it look much better in its final implementation than the images.

##Animations
We should explore animations in Java. Partially because the Timer has to be animated, but also because the game should have some animations. For example, if the target instruction was "RIGHT", the screen should "swipe" to the right (revealing the  next instruction beneath it) when the user hits the right arrow key.
