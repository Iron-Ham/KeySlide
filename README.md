## Contributing
1. In every class that needs it, make sure you have a *static* logger, and make sure to log every method upon entry and exit (if applicable)! This is especially important for event-listeners and controllers: correct usage of Logger makes debugging a breeze! You can look at the example of how I've used logger in the starter code. Make sure to read the documentation on the Logger object. 

2. Use Git Issues! Seriously, it's so important that we use and are on-top of Git issues. 

3. Be creative, comment often.

4. Code Review. Code review is so important! Spend the first part of your proramming session integrating the suggestions made to you through code review into your project. At the end of your session, spend some time with the code that you *didn't* write, and make sure to flag any issues and make suggestions.
