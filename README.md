## Setting Up The Project
This is a standard Eclipse project. However, there are a few things that must be done in order to be able to compile this project. Make sure that your compiler Compliance level is at least 1.7 (but you should really be using 1.8). 

## General Rules
1. In every class that needs it, make sure you have a *static* logger, and make sure to log every method upon entry and exit (if applicable)! This is especially important for event-listeners and controllers. You can look at the example of how I've used logger in the starter code. Make sure to read the documentation on the Logger object. 

2. Use Git Issues! Seriously, it's so important that we use and are on-top of Git issues. 

3. Be creative, comment often. Let's not play the "What were...they... trying to do...?" game. 

## Code Review?
Do y'all want to do code review? I think it's a good idea. At my co., we spend the first part of each development cycle integrating and improving code, as suggested by code review, and the final part of each cycle reviewing the cycle's submissions. I suggest we do something similar, as it will help us catch issues quickly.
