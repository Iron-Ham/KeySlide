## Contributing
1. In every class that needs it, make sure you have a *static* logger, and make sure to log every method upon entry and exit (if applicable)! This is especially important for event-listeners and controllers: correct usage of Logger makes debugging a breeze! You can look at the example of how I've used logger in the starter code. Make sure to read the documentation on the Logger object.
2. Use Git Issues! Seriously, it's so important that we use and are on-top of Git issues. 
3. Document your code.
4. Code Review. Spend part of your proramming session integrating the suggestions made to you through code review into your project and part of your time with the code that you *didn't* write -- make sure to flag any issues and make suggestions. 
5. Each new feature should have its own branch! If you are planning on building something like a specific panel or set of GUI elements, please branch the repository, and then submit a merge request!
